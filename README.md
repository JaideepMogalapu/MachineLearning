# Description : 
Prediction of crimes plays a crucial role in urban as well
rural areas. This project focuses on what are the crimes that
are committed frequently, describing the purpose of the crime,
and predicting the future crimes. For the first task of frequently
committed crimes we use exploratory data analysis techniques
to find the patterns in the data and the later part of the
project is predicted using machine learning algorithms. For
the classification tasks ensemble classifiers like decision tree
and random forest are used .
